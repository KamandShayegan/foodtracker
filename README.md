This application is a demo on how to use StreamBuilders with Firebase RealTime database.

Brief Description:
All the people having this application, can see changes on each meal, preventing overlaps on feeding Odin (my dog).

NOTE:
The data on this database can be read and written by anyone, so it's basically for one dog at the moment and requires no authentication.

UPDATE: The readltime database 'odins-food-tracker' has been deactivated, though the config files and the entire codebase works over an activated realtime database.
