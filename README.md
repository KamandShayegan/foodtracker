This application is just a demo on how to use StreamBuilders with Firebase.

Brief Description:
All the people having this application, can see changes on each meal, preventing overlaps on giving Odin food; hence, *NO* reloading the page is required.

NOTE:
The data on this database can be read and written by anyone, so it's basically just for one dog at the moment.
